My [Ludum Dare 54](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/54/cosmostride) submission

>*In the endless expanse of space, there is only so much you can do to fend off the endless waves of killer units, how much of an impact can you make with your limited resources?*
>
>*Itâ€™s time to give those who remain hope that the enemy can be overcome.*

## Gameplay
This is an on-rails shooter, a-la StarFox. Use the `WASD` keys to maneuver your ship and dodge oncoming enemy attacks, and `Left Mouse Button` to shoot them down. You can also press the `R` key mid-game to prompt restart.

After each level you'll be given a choice of 5 upgrade modules you can install to 3 different slots for your ship.
